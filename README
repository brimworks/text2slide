== Purpose ==

This command line tool takes as input:

 [1] A "Theme" (*.thmx) file.

 [2] The name of a "Layout" within the theme.

 [3] A plain text file formatted as described below.

It then generates a *.pptx that has been tested to work with
PowerPoint 2010 (may also work with other power point programs, but
YMMV).

== Format Of Plain Text ==

The plain text format is simple.  Perhaps in the future we can have
more advanced formatting, but the point is to make the plain text easy
to visualize on a slide.

--
Title goes between two "--" characters (newlines are not permitted).
--

Content of each slide continues until a "--" is found with a blank
line before and a blank line after it.

Empty lines are permitted and are preserved, however all other space
is trimmed.

--

Next slide content is here.  Even though there is no "--" after this
content, this is still placed on a separate slide.
